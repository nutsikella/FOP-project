This is an interpreter written in Java for GOLANG language subset, which includes all simple expressions necessary for implementing given 10 algorithms in the GO language. 

Here is a complete list  of all expressions in given subset of go language:
1. variable type declaration - var n int (only int type)
2. fmt.Print()
3. fmt.Println()   (note: print and println won't execute if theres no input, can only print String and variable inputs seperately, no concatination)
4. assignment and declaration operators :=,=
5. for loop with one condition to be checked: for (boolean expression) {} 
6. boolean operators >,<
7. arithmetic operators +,-,/,*,%
8. if, if-else conditions 
9. return statement that only exits the program, doesn't return any values


List of algorithms: 
1. factorial: works
2. fibonacci: works 
3. GCD
4. largest digit: works 
5. multiplication table: works 
6. reversing a number: works
7. palindrome number: works
8. prime number: works
9, sum: works
10. sum of digits: works
